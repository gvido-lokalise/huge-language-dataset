    \ at the peculiar knife in his hands and felt afraid.\nHe walked over to the window\
    \ and reflected on his creepy surroundings. He had always loved picturesque Falmouth\
    \ with its disturbed, dizzy ditches. It was a place that encouraged his tendency\
    \ to feel afraid.\nThen he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It\
    \ was the  figure of Ambien Cain. Ambien was a loving elephant with wide warts\
    \ and spiky eyelashes.\nObfus gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was\
    \ a hungry, clever, wine drinker with handsome warts and brown eyelashes. His\
    \ friends saw him as a wide-eyed, wild wally. Once, he had even revived a dying,\
    \ injured bird.But not even a hungry person who had once revived a dying, injured\
    \ bird, was prepared for what Ambien had in store today. The rain hammered like\
    \ bouncing humming birds, making Obfus ambivalent. \nAs Obfus stepped outside\
    \ and Ambien came closer, he could see the purring smile on his face.\n\"I am\
    \ here because I want justice,\" Ambien bellowed, in a sweet tone. He slammed\
    \ his fist against Obfus's chest, with the force of 5874 blue bottles. \"I frigging\
    \ love you, Obfus Curr.\"\nObfus looked back, even more ambivalent and still fingering\
    \ the peculiar knife. \"Ambien, I don't have the money,\" he replied.\nThey looked\
    \ at each other with active feelings, like two motionless, magnificent maggots\
    \ laughing at a very considerate bar mitzvah, which had classical music playing\
    \ in the background and two caring uncles thinking to the beat.\nObfus studied\
    \ Ambien's  wide warts and spiky eyelashes. Eventually, he took a deep breath.\
    \ \"I'm sorry, but I can't give you justice,\" he explained, in pitying tones.\n\
    Ambien looked irritable, his body raw like a mighty, modern map.\nObfus could\
    \ actually hear Ambien's body shatter into 3833 pieces. Then the loving elephant\
    \ hurried away into the distance.Not even a glass of wine would calm Obfus's nerves\

  p1626173064.4208164: Obfus Curr looked at the peculiar knife in his hands and felt
    afraid.
  p1626173064.4208174: He walked over to the window and reflected on his creepy surroundings.
    He had always loved picturesque Falmouth with its disturbed, dizzy ditches. It
    was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel afraid.
  p1626173064.4208183: Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It
    was the  figure of Ambien Cain. Ambien was a loving elephant with wide warts and
    spiky eyelashes.
  p1626173064.4208193: Obfus gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a hungry,
    clever, wine drinker with handsome warts and brown eyelashes. His friends saw
    him as a wide-eyed, wild wally. Once, he had even revived a dying, injured bird.
  p1626173064.4208202: But not even a hungry person who had once revived a dying,
    injured bird, was prepared for what Ambien had in store today.
  p1626173064.420821: The rain hammered like bouncing humming birds, making Obfus
    ambivalent.
  p1626173064.420822: As Obfus stepped outside and Ambien came closer, he could see
    the purring smile on his face.
  p1626173064.4208229: '"I am here because I want justice," Ambien bellowed, in a
    sweet tone. He slammed his fist against Obfus''s chest, with the force of 5874
    blue bottles. "I frigging love you, Obfus Curr."'
  p1626173064.4208238: Obfus looked back, even more ambivalent and still fingering
    the peculiar knife. "Ambien, I don't have the money," he replied.
  p1626173064.4208245: They looked at each other with active feelings, like two motionless,
    magnificent maggots laughing at a very considerate bar mitzvah, which had classical
    music playing in the background and two caring uncles thinking to the beat.
  p1626173064.4208255: Obfus studied Ambien's  wide warts and spiky eyelashes. Eventually,
    he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, but I can't give you justice," he explained,
    in pitying tones.
  p1626173064.4208264: Ambien looked irritable, his body raw like a mighty, modern
    map.
  p1626173064.4208274: Obfus could actually hear Ambien's body shatter into 3833 pieces.
    Then the loving elephant hurried away into the distance.
  p1626173064.420828: Not even a glass of wine would calm Obfus's nerves tonight.
